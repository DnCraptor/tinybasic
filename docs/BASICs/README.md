# BASICs

This folder contains examples and documentation for historical BASICs. I used some of them to program my own BASIC interpreter. Some I just conserve here for the fun of it.

## Licenses, Copyright and Intellectual Property

Most of these documents were once copyrighted information. As I found all of this as free downloads on the internet, I did not research the licence status. This is a time machine back into the beginning of computing. Most of these documents are 40 years old and older. I feel that having this things freely available will not violate anyones rights or interests. If you find your material here and want it removed, please contact me. I will delete the files immediately. 

## The books

### General Books on BASIC

**David Ahl's 101 BASIC Computer Games, March 1975 edition**. I used these programs to test my interpreter. It can run all of them. [101_BASIC_Computer_Games_Mar75.pdf](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/101_BASIC_Computer_Games_Mar75.pdf)

**Basic_Handbook_2nd_Edition_1981_CompuSoft_Publishing**. Compares many BASIC dialects. A great list of features and language styles, written by David Lien. [Basic_Handbook_2nd_Edition_1981_CompuSoft_Publishing-2](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/Basic_Handbook_2nd_Edition_1981_CompuSoft_Publishing-2.pdf)

### Palo Alto Tinybasic

**Palo Alto Tiny BASIC**. This is how I started. From this document the first interpreter was implemented from scratch. I kept compatibility to this language although the code now is far away from the Tinybasic language set. [TinyBASIC-2.0.pdf](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/TinyBASIC-2.0.pdf)

### Apple 1 and related stuff

**Apple 1 BASIC User Manual**. Steve Wozniaks draft manual. I used this to implement the second layer of BASIC commands. Tokenization and substring logic was taken from this. [apple1_basic_manual.pdf](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/apple1_basic_manual.pdf)

**The Apple 1 BASIC assembler source**. I never used this. Eric Smith disassembled the original ROM. [a1basic.asm](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/a1basic.asm)

### Cromemco and North Star BASIC

Two commercial BASICs seem seems to have inherited their core DNA from Apple 1 BASIC and from Palo Alto BASIC. The similarities are amazing. They didn't survive after Microsoft started to dominate the market.

**Cromenco BASIC**: [An Introduction to Structured BASIC for the Cromemco C-10](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/An%20Introduction%20to%20Structured%20BASIC%20for%20the%20Cromemco%20C-10.pdf)

**North Star BASIC**:[North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf](North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf)

### Microsofts early BASICs

**Altair BASIC**. This BASIC started the home computer revolution on the first Altair computers. Remarkable software engineering. This indroduced RIGHT, LEFT, MID string operations. [AltairBasic_1275.pdf](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/AltairBasic_1275.pdf)

**Aim 65 BASIC**. Another variant of the early Microsoft BASIC. Build for the legendary AIM65. [aim65_basic.pdf](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/aim65_basic.pdf)
