# BASICs

This folder contains examples and documentation for historical BASICs. I used some of them to program my own BASIC interpreter. Some I just conserve here for the fun of it.

## Licenses, Copyright and Intellectual Property

Most of these documents were once copyrighted information. As I found all of this as free downloads on the internet, I did not research the licence status. This is a time machine back into the beginning of computing. Most of these documents are 40 years old and older. I feel that having this things freely available will not violate anyones rights or interests. If you find your material here and want it removed, please contact me. I will delete the files immediately. 

## The books

**David Ahl's 101 BASIC Computer Games, March 1975 edition**. I used these programs to test my interpreter. It can run all of them. [101_BASIC_Computer_Games_Mar75.pdf](https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/blob/main/docs/BASICs/101_BASIC_Computer_Games_Mar75.pdf)
