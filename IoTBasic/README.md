# IoT BASIC for Arduino

Use the files in this folder in your Arduino IDE. This is the stable code. 

## The files 

IoTBASIC.ino is the sketch file with the main interpreter code. 

basic.h is the header file with the function prototypes and static variables of BASIC.

hardware-arduino.h is the hardware abstraction library.

## How to compile the code

Before building BASIC, edit IoTBASIC.ino and the select the language set you want to compile. Follow the instructions in the wiki https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/wiki in "How to compile".

You also need to edit hardware-arduino.h and select the hardware options. This is explained in the wiki as well.
