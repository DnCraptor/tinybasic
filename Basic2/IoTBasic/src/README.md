Special libraries used by the interpreter. This is mainly libraries that are either not common in the Arduino world or libraries I have patched to work with the BASIC interpreter.

Libraries currently provided with the interpreter: 

EepromFS: A small filesystem for EEPROMs. Common EEPROM sizes of 4kB and 32kB are autodetected. Author: Stefan Lenz, Licence like the interpreter itself. Github: https://github.com/slviajero/EepromFS
