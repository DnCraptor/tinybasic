Special libraries used by the interpreter. This is mainly libraries that are either not common in the Arduino world or libraries I have patched to work with the BASIC interpreter.

Libraries currently provided with the interpreter as bundled components are:

EEPROM emulations

EepromFS: A small EEPROM filesystem for EEPROMs. Common EEPROM sizes of 4kB and 32kB are autodetected. This component is also used for buffered I2C EPPROM access. Author: Stefan Lenz, Licence like the interpreter itself. Github: https://github.com/slviajero/EepromFS

XMCEEPROMLib: A EEPROM emulation for Infineon XMC boards. Some software components of Infineon have been used. Emulation code by Stefan Lent, Licence like the interpreter. Github: https://github.com/slviajero/XMCEEPROMLib

FlashStorage_SAMD: Chris Maglie's and Khoi Huang's flash storage for SAMD. Licence and Github see: https://github.com/khoih-prog/FlashStorage_SAMD
