# Example programs for Arduino systems

## Arduino systems

These demo programs show Arduino hardware features in BASIC, mainly for the standalone systems in https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/wiki. 

## Programs 

### Just a plain Arduino board

This runs on all board with a buildin LED. An Arduino UNO would be fine. Compile the interpreter with #define BASICINTEGER for the full language set with integer.

- HelloWorld: hello.bas - the inevitable hello world program
- Blink: blink.bas - blinking with the buildin LED
- Minmax: minmax.bas - reading data, calculating minimum and maximum
- StoreEEPROM: steeprom.bas - storing data in the EEPROM

### The LCD shield



## BASIC language features 

hello.bas: the PRINT statement

blink.bas: PINM, DELAY, LED and DWRITE
