# Arduino examples 05.Control ported to basic

## Programs 

- Arrays: arrays.bas - using arrays to drive a row of LEDs
- ForLoopIterations: forloop.bas - iterate through pins 
- IfStatementConditional: ifstatc.bas - measure an analog pins with threshold
- Switch: switch.bas - report sensor values with several thershold values
- Switch2: switch2.bas - control digital outputs by character input
- WhileStatementConditional: whilest.bas - conditional loops 

## BASIC language features 

The examples in the folder need #BASICINTEGER as a language stetting. This is a full featured integer BASIC.

DIM statement to dimension arrays. DATA and READ to load constants.

Arduino functions DELAY, DWRITE and PINM.

FOR TO STEP NEXT commands in BASIC. 

IF THEN ELSE conditional expressions.

ON GOSUB and ON GOTO expression analogous to C type switch() case:

Using GET and AVAIL to read character type variables. 

Using string constants as character values.

Use GOSUB RETURN for multiline functions.
