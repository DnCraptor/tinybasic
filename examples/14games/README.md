# Example programs for from 101 BASIC games 

## 101 BASIC games 

This was a printed library of games in the 70s. Many examples of ultra short BASIC programs. They are ported here to the Arduino BASIC dialect. Many of the games run on Integer BASIC.

## Programs 

- TicTacToe: tictac.bas - a "computer plays first" tictactoe game
- TicTacToe (improved): tictac2.bas - a tictactoe game with board display
- Rocket: rocket.bas - the classical lunar lander simulation
- HighLow: hi-lo.bas - guessing a number between 1 and 100
- 23Matches: 23match.bas - remove 1, 2, or 3 matches from a pile of 23
- Number: number guessing game, super simple almost Tinybasic compatible
- BuzzWork: create a buzzword bingo winning phrases, from the 70s but still up to date
- Guess: a simple number guessing showing many BASIC language features
- Love: draws a square the the message love
